# Building Reuseable and Trustworthy ELT pipelines
## A templated approach

---

## So much debt

1. solve the same problem again and again
2. Undocumented and Untested final result
3. Most breakages are caused by other people

---

## Stories

1. Toil
2. Data Trust
3. Data Discovery
4. Throw over the boundary overhead


---

## The Big Idea


---

## ETL vs ELT


---

## EL - Singer

---

## T - DBT

---

## Testing - GE

---

## Bring it all together

Airflow does what it does best - Orchestrate
Operators for all the above
Yaml declaration for dry


---

## Benifits of this approach

1. Easily to debug code
2. Speed to delivery
3. Tests
4. Auto-Docs
