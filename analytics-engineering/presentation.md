## Journey so far - Data Teams

---

![inline](https://nehiljain.com/images/data-team-old.png)

- Compute was expensive or complex
- Few Data team(s)
- Away from domain experts

^ Slow and bottleneck

---

![inline](https://nehiljain.com/images/data-team-new.png)


- Domain experts close to data
- Collaborate via metadata
- Reuseable reports


^ Quick Feedback loop/Speed
Missing data has meaning
Still lot of uncertainity
